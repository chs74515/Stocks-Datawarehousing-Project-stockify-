# Stockify
A stock performance analyzer application to visualize stocks data of a warehouse.
The goal of this project is to develop a data warehouse for analyzing the trend of financial market and maximizing usersâ€™ investments. The type of stocks i chose to first analyze was the US stock prices of the End of Day (EOD) data. Here is what the data warehousing schema looks like (from initial design this can be changed) for financial market analysis. Finally, I have implemented a web application of analytical models for forecasting information to help decision making of the users.
